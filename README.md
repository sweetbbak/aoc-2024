# Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„ðŸ¤¶ðŸŽ…ðŸŽ„

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!
This is my take on the AoC for 2024, written in `Zig` mach `0.14.0-dev.1911+3bf89f55c`

My rules:

- _no_ LLMs, "AI" or otherwise
- no peeking at others answers (unless you have given it your best attempt and exhausted all options)
  if you _do_ look at others answers, cite them.
- make the process, output, and answers verbose (ie: debug printing and code comments)
- try your best!

## building and testing

cd into any of the `dayXXX` directories and run `zig build run`

### Day 1

This one was easy (as the first days usually seem to be) I just opened my input, split the input by the sequence of three spaces.
I then parsed the integers into a zig `usize` and appended each integer from each line into a seperate `ArrayList` from the stdlib.
Then I sorted those lists in place using `std.mem.sort` which was comically easy to do.

This uses [this implementation](https://github.com/BonzaiThePenguin/WikiSort/blob/master/WikiSort.c) under the hood which is really
well done and very efficient. It swaps values in place in chunks of 4-8 and handles a lot of edge cases.

```zig
std.mem.sort(usize, left.items, {}, comptime std.sort.asc(usize));
std.mem.sort(usize, right.items, {}, comptime std.sort.asc(usize));
```

Then I can just iterate over both lists at the same time since they are the same length, use `@abs(x - y)` or `@abs(y - x)` depending on
what is larger (there is probably a better way to do this) and then add that to total.

For part 2, I did basically the same thing but then iterated over the left hand list once, and then for each iteration of that list, I iterated over the right
hand list entirely. I counted how many times the current number occured in the right list, and multiplied that by the current number. I then added that to
a variable in the outer scope to tally the total.

I used a fun little `labeled block` that evaluates some expression and returns that value. [info on labeled blocks](https://zig.guide/master/language-basics/labelled-blocks)
which is one of the coolest things in `Zig` in my opinion. It's a neat way to express things.

but it was as simple as doing:

```zig
    var total: u64 = 0;

    for (left.items) |x| {
        const c = blk: {
            var counter: u64 = 0;
            for (right.items) |y| {
                if (x == y) {
                    counter += 1;
                }
            }
            break :blk counter;
        };
```

where `left.items` and `right.items` are lists (or arrays, slices, etc...) of the same type.

### Day 2

I got this one pretty much right away, but I made a silly mistake that left me debugging for longer than I wanted to. I ended up peeking at someone else's
[work](https://github.com/makyinmars/aoc-24/blob/main/src/2.zig) for Part 2 as a sanity check. I had the idea correct, but used an "or" when I needed to use an "and" lol... but anyways
this one was simple. I just iterated over each line and then checked if they were already sorted or not in both ascending and descending order, if they were,
I got the difference of each number with the next number in the list. Then I checked that the difference was between 1-3.

For part 2, I did the exact same thing, but iterated over the array list and removed an item from the list and then checked it against the same function as above.

the MVP this round is the `std.sort` library and the `std.ArrayList`

```zig
    for (list, 0..) |_, i| {
        var newlist = std.ArrayList(u8).init(allocator);
        defer newlist.deinit();

        for (list, 0..) |val, x| {
            if (x == i) continue;
            try newlist.append(val);
        }

        const _list = try newlist.toOwnedSlice();
        defer allocator.free(_list);

        const good = try parse_numbers(_list);
        if (good) return true;
    }
```
